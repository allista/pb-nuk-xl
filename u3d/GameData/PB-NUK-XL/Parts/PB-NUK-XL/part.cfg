description = After some playing around with a dozen of PB-NUK generators kerbal engeneers noticed that if you place them close enought, they (despite their protective shells) become warmer and warmer and... fortunately, one of them managed to kick the pile apart with a rover in time!  This, nevertheless, didn't stop them from repeating the experiment in a more... controllable environment (the rover was prepared beforehand). Thus the PB-NUK-XL was born. Unlike the small model, this monster cannot convert all it's energy into electricity and needs a heatsink.
