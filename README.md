This is a simple part mod based on the [Kethane](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/23979-Kethane "Kethane") mod, so without Kethane the part will do nothing. It adds a heavy version of the stock PB-NUK generator under the Experimental Electrics in R&D tree. It doesn't use resources and is switchable; aside form Electric Charge it produces Waste Heat (which maintained by Kethane) and has a custom model with animated heatsink fins. While Kethane Generator produces 75EC/sec, PB-NUK-XL produces 100, but  it is much much heavier (4.5t vs 0.3t). Thus, it's main use (for which it was originally created at least) is a power supply for stationary mining colonies in places with a long night period like tidally locked moons. It may also be used to power other power-hungry equipment like VASIMR engines.
